#Melox - music streaming app

I've written this app as a final project for my Frameworks in Web Applications class. 
This is typical MERN stack app that enables user authentication as well as playing most popular songs on spotify.
Server side was written in JavaScript, Node.js and Express.js and MongoDB as NoSQL Database.
Client side was written in JavaScript, React.js and Redux
In the app I also used SpotifyAPI from RapidAPI.
