# MELOX - MERN Stack Spotify Integration App

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my final project in the Frameworks in Web Applications class. This application is a well-rounded demonstration of a MERN stack application, featuring user authentication and the ability to stream Spotify's most popular songs.

## Project Overview

This project exemplifies a typical MERN stack application, highlighting my skills in integrating multiple technologies to create a functional, user-centric web application.

### Server-Side Development

- **Technologies Used**: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB, chosen for its efficiency and flexibility as a NoSQL database.
- **Functionality**: The server-side primarily manages user authentication processes and interacts with the client-side to ensure smooth data handling.

### Client-Side Development

- **Technologies Used**: JavaScript, React.js, Redux.
- **Spotify Integration**: The front end exclusively handles the integration with Spotify's API, fetched from RapidAPI, enabling users to stream the most popular songs directly within the app.
- **User Interface**: Developed with React.js and managed with Redux to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Purpose and Functionality

The main objective of this project was to create a dynamic web application using the MERN stack for my coursework, demonstrating my capability in full-stack development and API integration.

## Getting Started

To explore and run this project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions for both the server and client sides.
3. Install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run the application to experience its features firsthand.
